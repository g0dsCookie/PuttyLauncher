# PuttyLauncher

PuttyLauncher is a plugin for [WinCommandPalette](https://github.com/DarkIrata/WinCommandPalette).

This plugin will load all your saved PuTTY sessions and create a command for them.
Also it creates a command to load all your private keys into pageant.

You can also create your own putty commands for SSH, Telnet, Rlogin, Raw and Serial.

# Installation

Download the latest release and extract the .zip file. Copy the *PuttyLauncher* directory into your *Plugins* directory
and finally restart WinCommandPalette.

# Reload sessions

To reload newly saved sessions you have to restart WinCommandPalette, as there is no API yet to add/remove commands.
